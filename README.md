# Hangman
In this program we will implement a variation of the game "Hangman". The goal of the game is to correctly guess a word or
phrase chosen by one of the players by guessing the letters that make them up.

In the first step, one of the players chooses a word, and writes horizontal lines next to each other as the number of letters.
The other player guesses letters: if the letter he guessed appears in the word chosen by the first player, 
then the player reveals the letter in all the places where it appears. If the guessed letter is wrong, 
the first player draws one part of a hanging pole with a person hanging on it and writes the wrong letter on the side. 
The guessing player must succeed in guessing the word before the first player completes the hanging pole.

In the game we assume the following conditions:
- The word that needs to be guessed is one and consists only of letters that are lower case.
- The letters in the template that are not visible will be represented by the character _ (underline).
- The pattern, word and letters are represented as strings.
- The player can choose to guess one letter from the pattern, or the full word.
- A player is assigned a number of points at the beginning of each round of games.
   Each guess costs him a point, but he can earn extra points if the guesses are correct.
- The player can ask for a hint that offers him possible words for the solution, each request for a hint costs the player a point.
- We will not draw a hanging pole, unlike the original game. ðŸ˜¬
